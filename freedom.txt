So-called "free software" is software (that's said: programs for the computer)
distributed with a license permitting you to:
- run the program as you wish, for any purpose
- study how the program works, and change it
- redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor
- distribute copies of your modified versions to others

Don't be afraid to ask to the person who gave you this archive more informations
